Pymaceuticals needs to have their research data analyzed and plotted for new cancer treament drugs. In this data set, 248 mice were used to analyze 10 drug regimens (incliuding a placebo). Four of the regimens were selected to summarize and plot the results of the research. The selected drug regimens are: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin.

There is a strong correlation between weight and tumor size (e.g The greater the mouse weight, the larger the tumor).
Over time, Capomulin dramatically reduced the tumor volume in Mouse m957.
Capomulin and Ramicane have similiar quartile results while Infubinol and Ceftamin's results are similar to each other. The later pair had much higher tumor volumes after the final treatments. Only Infubinol had a final tumor volume that was outside the expected range. It would seem that Capomulin and Ramicane are much more effective in reducing tumor growth.
